### Here is your challenge for Day 1
### Project 1: Print into the World
Let's get started with your first project! After only one day, you already have something you can share with the world.

You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session.

+ Write your `full name` and `today's date` in separate lines of code.
```Hint
Don't forget "" and () when creating your print statements.
```
+ Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just the one `print` statement!
```
I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happend to be. 
No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
