### Here is your challenge for Day 1
### Project 1: Print into the World
Let's get started with your first project! After only one day, you already have something you can share with the world.

You can continue to use this same repl for your project. Just make sure you delete any previous code from our practice session.

+ Write your `full name` and `today's date` in separate lines of code.
```Hint
Don't forget "" and () when creating your print statements.
```
+ Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just the one `print` statement!
```
I am signing up for GitHub's 100 days
of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time
every day coding along, for a minimum
of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using GitHub, an amazing
version control system so I can do this
from my computer or any device. No
excuses for not coding from anywhere!
