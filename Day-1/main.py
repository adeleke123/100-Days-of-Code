I am signing up for GitHub's 100 days
of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time
every day coding along, for a minimum
of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using GitHub, an amazing
version control system so I can do this
from my computer or any device. No
excuses for not coding from anywhere!
I am feeling excited! ðŸ˜„
You can follow my progress at github.com/BakareMuideen""")
