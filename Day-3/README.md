Day 3 Challenge
The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker
We have learned enough skills for a simple, but cool, project!

Remember when you were a kid and thought the ideal dinner would just be all your favorite things mixed in a bowl? How did that Nutella Mac & Cheese taste? Well - let's come up with a recipe generator to build us an amazing dish for today's evening meal!

You will need to:

Create these as a variable:
A type of food
A type of plant
A method of cooking
A word to describe burned food
A household item
2. Output a nice looking Recipe page that *concatenates* a dish in this format:
cooking food with burned plant on a bed of item
Example (No Peeking the Solution Yet):
Name a food > Mac & Cheese
Name a type of plant > Cactus
Name a method of cooking > Saute        
What word describes burned food? > Ruined
Name a DIY item > Hammer
MENU
Saute Mac & Cheese with Ruined Cactus on a bed of Hammers


EXTRA: Remix your recipe to include more variables and a wackier type of dish.

Why not step it up and create a recipe for a starter, main course and dessert?
